Changes in version 2.7:
	* configure now checks for pangocairo >= 1.16, older pango does not
	  have pango_layout_get_line_readonly() required by fntsample
	* Fixed crash (segmentation fault) with some values for -i (and maybe
	  -x)

Changes in version 2.6:
	* pango is now used for drawing headers and numbers in font samples
	* Font sizes are now tunable using "--style" option. Default font
	  size for digits was made smaller for better look with fonts containing
	  glyphs outside BMP

Changes in version 2.5:
	* Added support for compiling with non-default fontconfig location
	* Added support for long options
	* Made some optimizations to text layout, this should make generated
	  PDFs smaller
	* Added options for selecting Unicode ranges to include in samples
	  (-i and -x)

Changes in version 2.4:
	* Added script for making pdf files with bookmarks (pdfoutline) and
	  option for fntsample to print bookmarks information (-l).
	  pdfoutline requires perl and PDF::API2 library

Changes in version 2.3:
	* Added "#include <unistd.h>" to get definition of getopt()

Changes in version 2.2:
	* Added support for fonts other than TrueType/OpenType
